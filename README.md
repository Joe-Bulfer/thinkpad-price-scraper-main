# thinkpad price scraper 

Lenovo Thinkpads are great laptops with a large community of collectors/users. Even 10 year old thinkpads are still often used, and preferred because of their reliability and modularity (i.e swap ram). I personally use a 10 year old X230 for most daily tasks.

It is useful for thinkpad enthusiasts to be aware of average prices and fluctuations in price. There is a thinkpad buyers guide article by Bobble Tech [here](https://www.bobble.tech/free-stuff/used-thinkpad-buyers-guide). However I am unsure if this is up to date and I plan to have a website dedicated to this one purpose, putting more effort into accurate data, scraped directly off Ebay.
